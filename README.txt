gwbn - goto window by name

This is my simple program to let you go to window by name in gnome
using the perl bindings for libwnck.  gwbn takes one argument which is
a regex for the window you want to go to.  It will go to whatever
window first matches that regex.

Very simple and brute force right now, but it works.  I'll make it
slicker over time.
